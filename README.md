# RedParrot: Accelerating NL-to-DSL for Business Analytics via Query Semantic Caching

This repository contains the code and datasets for the paper "RedParrot: Accelerating NL-to-DSL for Business Analytics via Query Semantic Caching".

> **Note on Availability:** A portion of the source code and all in-house datasets are currently undergoing an internal review process. They will be released publicly upon approval.

## Code

The source code for our project is provided in this repository.

## Datasets

We evaluated our model on two types of datasets:

1.  **In-house Datasets (Currently Private)**: Six datasets were built from real operational data at RedNote. These are pending release after an internal review.
2.  **New Public Benchmarks**: We introduce two new benchmarks, **Spider-DSL** and **BIRD-DSL**, which are synthesized from the popular Text-to-SQL datasets Spider and BIRD. These are available in this repository.

## Acknowledge
This work was conducted as part of a research collaboration between Zhejiang University and RedNote (Xiaohongshu). We thank our colleagues from both institutions for their valuable feedback and support.
